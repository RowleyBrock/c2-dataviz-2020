# Overview
The purpose of this lab is to get your working with *git* and *GitHub*
collaboratively, as well as to refresh some basic 
[{dplyr}](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) skills. You should
work together in groups of 3-4. At least one person in your group should have
prior experience with *git/GitHub*. The basics of the lab are to:

* Create a shared repo
* Create an R Markdown document
* Work on a few different data visualizations together
  + Different people make different commits
* Submit a link to the repo through Canvas when you've completed the lab
* I check the commit history, and give each person credit

## Data
We'll work with Week 1 of the [#tidytuesday](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tidytuesday&src=tyah) 
data for 2019, specifically the 
[#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typd)
dataset, containing nearly 500,000 tweets over a little more than a decade using
that hashtag. 

# Commits {.tabset}

Glance through the commits below. Each person should be responsible for **at least**
one commit. Commit 1 must be completed first. However, please work on Commits 2
4 simultaneously (one person working on each commit). Commits 3/5
cannot be completed until after Commits 2/4, respectively.

**Note:** You may end up with a merge conflict. That's okay, we're here to 
practice. I like [gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) for managing merge
conflicts (see [here](https://blog.axosoft.com/merge-conflict-tool/)) but you 
can use whatever works best for you.

## Commit 1

* Create a shared GitHub repo
* Create an RStudio project
* Create a folder in the repo called "data" and place the corresponding data there
* Initialize a new R Markdown document
* The data are available [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-01-01). Download the data and write the code to read it into R.
* Commit and push all new files/modification to the repo

```{r fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10, echo = FALSE}
d <- rio::import(here::here("data", "rstats_tweets.rds"),
                 setclass = "tbl_df") 
```

## Commit 2
First `pull` Commit 1, then reproduce the following figure. 

Some guidance:

* You'll want to count the number of times a screen name appears and select
  only the top 25.
  + Consider arranging in descending order, then using `dplyr::slice`
* Make the screen name a factor, ordered according to the number of times
  it appears.
  + Consider `forcats::fct_reorder`
* `coord_flip` will be your friend here

```{r fig1-raw}
library(tidyverse)
d %>% 
  count(screen_name, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  slice(1:25) %>% 
  mutate(screen_name = fct_reorder(factor(screen_name), n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(screen_name, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() 
```

## Commit 3
* Style the plot so it (mostly) matches the below. (Note it does not have to be perfect)
  
```{r fig1-styled}
d %>% 
  count(screen_name, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  slice(1:25) %>% 
  mutate(screen_name = fct_reorder(factor(screen_name), n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(screen_name, n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.9,
           fill = "cornflowerblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  labs(x = "Twitter Screen Name",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Most prolific #rstats tweeters",
       subtitle = "Top 25 screen names displayed",
       caption = "Data from Mike Kearny, distributed via #tidytuesday") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = "gray70"),
        plot.title.position = "plot")
```

## Commit 4
Create the following figure. 

Some guidance:

* First create a `month` variable that rounds the `created_at` column to 
  the nearest month. You might consider `lubridate::round_date`.
* Restrict the count to prior to 2019. I would recommend using 
  `lubridate::as_datetime("2019-01-01 00:00:00")`, or just restricting the x-axis
  through `ggplot`
* Count the number of rows (tweets) in the dataset for each month

```{r fig2-raw}
library(lubridate)
d %>% 
  mutate(month = round_date(created_at, unit = "month")) %>% 
  count(month) %>%
  filter(month < lubridate::as_datetime("2019-01-01 00:00:00")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_line()
```

## Commit 5
* Modify the plot so it (mostly) matches the below. (Note it does not have to be perfect)

```{r fig2-styled}
d %>% 
  mutate(month = round_date(created_at, unit = "month")) %>% 
  count(month) %>%
  filter(month < lubridate::as_datetime("2019-01-01 00:00:00")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, n)) +
  geom_area(fill = "cornflowerblue",
            alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line(lwd = 1.6, 
            color = "gray40") +
  geom_smooth(color = "magenta",
              lwd = 1.4,
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Year (data summarized by month)",
       y = "Number of #rstats tweets",
       title = "Growth of the #rstats hashtag on twitter over time",
       caption = "Data from Mike Kearny, distributed via #tidytuesday") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 20) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", colour = NA),
        plot.title.position = "plot")

```

# Finishing up
It is expected that this lab will take you more time that the 80 minutes we have
in class. Class time should be used to clarify any points of confusion
and if you run into issues after class, please get in touch with me so we can
arrange a time to meet and I can help you.

Once you have finished, please go to Canvas and submit a link to your shared
repo. Credit will be awarded based on the commit history.

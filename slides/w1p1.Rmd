# I assume you:
1. Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about them)

--
1. Can read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 
  + I don't care what you use, but you should be using RStudio Projects & I
    highly recommend [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here)
    - See [Jenny Bryan's blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for why.

--
1. Can perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
tidyverse
  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--
1. Use version control with R via git and GitHub 
  + .gray[I am, of course, there will need to be some catching up here]

--
1. Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports


---
# Learning objects for this class

* Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations

--

* Understand and fluently apply different types of data joins

--

* Customize ggplot2 graphics by reordering factors, creating themes, and applying ggthemes

--

* Create reproducible slides using ioslides/xaringan

--

* Create an online data visualization portfolio using radix and/or flexdashboards to demonstrate key learning 


---
# Weekly learning objectives

Provide you a frame for what you should be working to learn for that specific week.

--

### This week's objectives
* Understand the requirements of the course
* Understand the requirements of the final project
* Be ready to go with *git* and GitHub


---

# DataCamp
* Everyone should have received a datacamp invite this morning. Contact me if
not.
* Great platform for supplemental learning. 
* We'll use it as part of your homework

# Homework
10 points each (20 points; 10%)

* Basically the same as the labs, but scored correct/incorrect, and no in-class
  time devoted to them.

* Okay to work on collaboratively - I actively encourage you to do so as long as
  you're using a shared repo


--
First will be focused on joins and basically relational data (with visualizations built in)

Second will ask you to reproduce some data visualizations "in the wild" with publicly available data.

# Proposal

Four components:
* Description of the data source (**must** be publicly available)
* Preliminary ideas (even hand sketches) of different visualizations
* Identification of the intended audience for each visualization 
  + Note, you might consider displaying the same data/relations more than 
    once, with each plot displayed for a different audience.
* The intended message to be communicated for each plot. 

---
# Draft
* Expected to still be a work in progress
  + Data visualizations should be largely complete
* Deployment not expected
* Provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn 
  from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* We are all professionals here. It is imperative we act like it. 
* Understand the purpose of the exercise.  
* Zero tolerance policy for inappropriate comments
* Should be vigorously encouraging 


--
### Utilizing GitHub
* You'll be assigned three proposals to review (5 points each)
* Fork their repo
* Embed comments, suggest changes to their code
* Submit a PR
  + Summarize your overall review in the PR

---
# Presentation 
Order randomly assigned. Basically a chance to share what you created!

* Discuss what is trying to be communicated
* Share the final products
* Discuss the progression along the way and why specific changes were made

# Missing classes
# 😬
I will be out .bolder[all] of next week! 
* Trying desperately to get a guest speaker - most people I can think of will be at the conference with me.
* May end up just having to have you do the readings and work on a take-home lab


--
### February 6
* I will also be out February 6 (but should be able to be here on the 4th)
* I *think* I have a guest lecture lined up for that day, who will guide you through the lab.

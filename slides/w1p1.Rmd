# whoisyou?

* Introduce yourself
* Why are you here?

# A few class policies

--
* Be kind


--
* Be understanding and have patience, with others and yourself


--
* Help others whenever possible


--
Truly the most important part of this class. Important not just in terms of decency, but also in your learning, and most importantly, for equity. 

---
# A more specific policy
### Kiddos in class

--

1. All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.

--

2. Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of two young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.

--

3. In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child's needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.

--

4. All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.


---
# Last thing

* I'm here for you

* We won't have specific office hours, but know I'm always willing to meet

* This course, like all in the sequence, can be difficult. Don't suffer in silence. Don't do this alone.

# Course Website(s)

* [website](https://uo-datasci-specialization.github.io/c2-dataviz-2020/)
* [repo](https://github.com/uo-datasci-specialization/c2-dataviz-2020)

# A note on these slides
* All produced with R through R Markdown

* I'll try to always run `knitr::purl` on the slides before class so you have the code from the slides (occassionally won't be terrifically useful). These will be posted to Canvas.

* I'll also always try to get a PDF of the slides up and posted to canvas.

---
# I assume you:
1. Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about them)


--
1. Can read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 

  + I don't care what you use, but you should be using RStudio Projects & the [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here) package

    - See [Jenny Bryan's blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for why.

--
1. Can perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
tidyverse
  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--
1. Use version control with R via git and GitHub 

--
1. Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports


---
# Learning objects for this class

* Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations

--

* Understand and fluently apply different types of data joins

--
* Understand best practices in data visualization

--

* Customize ggplot2 graphics by reordering factors, creating themes, and applying ggthemes


--

* Create an online data visualization portfolio using distill and/or flexdashboards to demonstrate key learning 


---

# Lab Schedule

5 points each (30 points total; 15%)

1. GitHub collabo (**Assigned: 1/8/19**; **Due: 1/13/19**)

1. Mapping data to aesthetics (**Assigned: 1/15/19**; **Due: 1/20/19**)

    **Homework 1**

1. Visual perception (**Assigned: 1/29/19**; **Due: 2/3/19**)

1. Color (**Assigned: 2/5/19**; **Due: 2/10/19**)

    **Homework 2**

1. Tables/Uncertainty (**Assigned: 2/19/19**; **Due: 2/24/19**)



---
# Homework
10 points each (20 points; 10%)

* Basically the same as the labs, but scored correct/incorrect, and no in-class
  time devoted to them.

* Okay to work on collaboratively - I actively encourage you to do so as long as
  you're using a shared repo


--
First will be focused on joins and basically relational data (with visualizations built in)

Second will ask you to reproduce some data visualizations "in the wild" with publicly available data.


---
# Quick note on reproducibility
A [great blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/08/28/you-can-replicate-almost-any-plot-with-ggplot2/) by [Rafael Irizarry](https://twitter.com/rafalab) shows how almost any plot you see in popular media can be reproduced in R with ggplot.


--
### For example


---
# Wall Street Journal Version

![](img/measles_wsj.png) 

---
# ggplot reproduction

![](https://simplystatistics.org/post/2019-08-28-you-can-replicate-almost-any-plot-with-ggplot2_files/figure-html/wsj-vaccines-example-1.png)


---
## Data visualization "in the wild" presentations
Everyone will present for ~5 minutes - order randomly assigned (coming up next)

* Find two data viz examples intended for two different audiences

* Discuss the following
  - What's trying to be communicated
  - How effective do you judge it? Why?
  - At least 1 area of strength
  - At least 1 area for (potential) improvement

  skills.
  + [distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) (what I'll lecture on), 
    [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html), or
    [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) website

---
# Proposal

Four components:
* Description of the data source (**must** be publicly available)
* Preliminary ideas (even hand sketches) of different visualizations
* Identification of the intended audience for each visualization 
  + Note, you might consider displaying the same data/relations more than 
    once, with each plot displayed for a different audience.
* The intended message to be communicated for each plot. 

---
# Draft
* Expected to still be a work in progress
  + Data visualizations should be largely complete
* Deployment not expected
* Provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn 
  from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* We are all professionals here. It is imperative we act like it. 
* Understand the purpose of the exercise.  
* Zero tolerance policy for inappropriate comments
* Should be vigorously encouraging 


--
### Utilizing GitHub
* You'll be assigned three proposals to review (5 points each)
* Fork their repo
* Embed comments, suggest changes to their code
* Submit a PR
  + Summarize your overall review in the PR

---
# Presentation 
Order randomly assigned. Basically a chance to share what you created!

* Discuss what is trying to be communicated
* Share the final products
* Discuss the progression along the way and why specific changes were made

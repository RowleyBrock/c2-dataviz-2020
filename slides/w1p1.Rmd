# I assume you:
1. Understand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about them)


--
1. Can read "flat" (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R 

  + I don't care what you use, but you should be using RStudio Projects & I
    highly recommend [{here}](https://github.com/r-lib/here)

    - See [Jenny Bryan's blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/) for why.

--
1. Can perform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the
tidyverse
  + Leverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)
  + "clean up" the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows

--
1. Use version control with R via git and GitHub 

--
1. Use R Markdown to create reproducible dynamic reports


---
# Learning objects for this class

* Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations

--

* Understand and fluently apply different types of data joins

--

* Customize ggplot2 graphics by reordering factors, creating themes, and applying ggthemes


--

* Create an online data visualization portfolio using radix and/or flexdashboards to demonstrate key learning 


---
# Weekly learning objectives

Provide you a frame for what you should be working to learn for that specific week.

--

### This week's objectives
* Understand the requirements of the course
* Understand the requirements of the final project
* Be ready to go with *git* and GitHub


---

# Extra credit opportunity
* 10 points: Deep dive into a topic not covered by the course


--
### Some options
.gray[We'll talk about this more in a minute]
* Geographic data (we'll have an intro, but there's a ton here and we won't really do it justice)
* Network data
* Flow data (alluvial diagrams)
* Relational data (SQL & friends)
* Interactive plots
* Animated plots
* Text data, text nets


---
# Lab Schedule

5 points each (30 points total; 15%)

1. GitHub collabo (**Assigned: 1/8/19**; **Due: 1/13/19**)

1. Mapping data to aesthetics (**Assigned: 1/15/19**; **Due: 1/20/19**)

    **Homework 1**

1. Visual perception (**Assigned: 1/29/19**; **Due: 2/3/19**)

1. Color (**Assigned: 2/5/19**; **Due: 2/10/19**)

    **Homework 2**

1. Tables/Uncertainty (**Assigned: 2/19/19**; **Due: 2/24/19**)



---
# Homework
10 points each (20 points; 10%)

* Basically the same as the labs, but scored correct/incorrect, and no in-class
  time devoted to them.

* Okay to work on collaboratively - I actively encourage you to do so as long as
  you're using a shared repo


--
First will be focused on joins and basically relational data (with visualizations built in)

Second will ask you to reproduce some data visualizations "in the wild" with publicly available data.


---
# Final Project 
120 points total (60%)

6 parts:
* Proposal (10 points): Due 2/5/19
* Draft (15 points): Due 2/26/19
* Peer review (15 points): Assigned, 2/26/19; Due 3/4/19
* Presentation (20 points): 3/9/19 and 3/11/19 (Week 10)
* Product (60 points): Due 11:59:59 PM, 3/18/19


---
# Product

Four components: 

* A web-deployed portfolio showcasing your [#dataviz](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataViz&src=tyah)
  skills.
  + [radix](https://rstudio.github.io/radix/) (what I'll lecture on), 
    [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html), or
    [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) website
  + Technical document with [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) or
    [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
  + Scientific poster with [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown)
  + [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/)
* At least three finalized data displays, with each accompanied by a strong 
  narrative/story, as well as the history of how the visualization changed over 
  time.
* Housed on GitHub
  + Fully reproducible
* Deployed through [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) (or netlify or similar if you're feeling brave)


---
# Proposal

Four components:
* Description of the data source (**must** be publicly available)
* Preliminary ideas (even hand sketches) of different visualizations
* Identification of the intended audience for each visualization 
  + Note, you might consider displaying the same data/relations more than 
    once, with each plot displayed for a different audience.
* The intended message to be communicated for each plot. 

---
# Draft
* Expected to still be a work in progress
  + Data visualizations should be largely complete
* Deployment not expected
* Provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn 
  from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* We are all professionals here. It is imperative we act like it. 
* Understand the purpose of the exercise.  
* Zero tolerance policy for inappropriate comments
* Should be vigorously encouraging 


--
### Utilizing GitHub
* You'll be assigned three proposals to review (5 points each)
* Fork their repo
* Embed comments, suggest changes to their code
* Submit a PR
  + Summarize your overall review in the PR

---
# Presentation 
Order randomly assigned. Basically a chance to share what you created!

* Discuss what is trying to be communicated
* Share the final products
* Discuss the progression along the way and why specific changes were made


---
# Grading
200 points total
* 5 labs at 6 points each (30 points; 15%) 
* 2 homework assignments at 20 points each (40 points; 20%) 
* five-minute data visualization "in the wild" presentation (10 points; 5%) 
* Final Project (120 points; 60%)
  + Proposal (10 points; 5%)
  + Draft (15 points; 7.5%)
  + Peer review (15 points; 7.5%)

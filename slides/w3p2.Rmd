# Learning Objectives

* Understand and be able to identify keys

* Understand different types of joins
  + left, right, inner, full
  + one-to-one, one-to-many

* Understand common ways joins fail

* Understand the difference between mutating and filtering joins

---
# Before we get started
* Today we'll talk about both mutating and filtering joins

* Mutating joins are more common, but filtering joins can be really powerful

* Mutating joins add columns to a dataset


--
### What if I want to add rows?
* Not technically a join (no key involved, which we'll talk about momentarily)


---
# Quick example, binding rows
```{r g34-datsets}
g3 <- tibble(sid = 1:3, 
             grade = rep(3, 3), 
             score = as.integer(rnorm(3, 200,10)))

g4 <- tibble(sid = 9:11, 
             grade = rep(4, 3), 
             score = as.integer(rnorm(3, 200,10)))
```

.pull-left[
```{r g3-print}
g3
```
]


.pull-left[
```{r g4-print}
g4
```
]

---
# `bind_rows`
* In examples like the previous datasets, we just want to "staple" the rows
together. 

* We can do so with `bind_rows`.

```{r bind_rows1}
bind_rows(g3, g4)
```

---
# Optional `.id` argument
* What if we knew the grade, but didn't have a variable in each dataset already?
* Use `.id` to add an index for each dataset

```{r bind_rows2}
bind_rows(g3[ ,-2], g4[ ,-2], .id = "dataset")
```

---

```{r bind_rows_id_mutate}
bind_rows(g3[ ,-2], g4[ ,-2], .id = "dataset") %>%
  mutate(grade = ifelse(dataset == 1, 3, 4))
```

---
# Even better usage

```{r bind_rows3}
bind_rows(g3 = g3[ ,-2], g4 = g4[ ,-2], .id = "grade")
```

---
## What if columns don't match exactly?
* Pad with `NA`

```{r bind_rows4}
bind_rows(g3, g4[ ,-2], .id = "dataset")
```

---
# Last note - read in a bunch of files
* We'll talk about this a lot more in the next course
* `purrr::map_df` uses `bind_rows` in the background

--
```{r write_files}
dir.create("tmp")

mtcars %>%
  split(.$cyl) %>%
  walk2(c("tmp/cyl4.csv", "tmp/cyl6.csv", "tmp/cyl8.csv"),
        write_csv)

list.files("tmp")
```

---
# Read in files

* Use `purrr::map_df` with the file names
* Note `fs::dir_ls` is equivalent to `list.files`, but plays nicer with
  `purrr::map_df`

```{r read_files}
new_mtcars <- map_df(fs::dir_ls("tmp"), rio::import, setclass = "tbl_df",
                     .id = "file")
new_mtcars %>%
  select(file, mpg, cyl) %>%
  slice(1:3)
unlink("tmp", recursive = TRUE)
```

# Joins
(not to be confused with row binding)

---
# Keys
* Uniquely identify rows in a dataset


--

* Variable(s) in common between two datasets to be joined


--

  + A key can be more than one variable


--
### Types of keys
* Small distinction that you probably won't have to worry about much, but is
worth mentioning:
  + **Primary keys:** Uniquely identify observations in their dataset
  + **Foreign keys:** Uniquely identify observations in other datasets. 


---
# What's the primary key here? 

```{r load_ecls-k}
library(rio)
library(here)
ecls <- import(here("data", "ecls-k_samp.sav"), setclass = "tbl_df") %>% 
    characterize()
ecls
```

---
# Double-checking

```{r double_check_ecls}
ecls %>% 
    count(child_id) 
```

---

```{r }
ecls %>% 
    count(child_id) %>%
    filter(n > 1)
```

---
# What about here?

```{r primary_key_income_ineq}
income_ineq <- import(here("data", "incomeInequality_tidy.csv"), 
                      setclass = "tbl_df")
income_ineq 
```

---

```{r double_check_income_ineq}
income_ineq %>% 
    count(Year, percentile) %>% 
    filter(n > 1)
```

---
# Sometimes there is no key
* These tables have an *implicit* id - the row numbers. For example:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r flights}
flights
```

---

```{r no_key}
flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, flight, tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

---
# Create a key
* If there is no key, it's often helpful to add one. These are called *surrogate* keys.

```{r add_key}
flights <- flights %>% 
  rowid_to_column()

flights %>% 
  select(1:3, ncol(flights))
```

# Mutating joins

---
# Mutating joins
* In *tidyverse*, we use `mutate()` to create new variables within a dataset.

--

* A mutating join works similarly, in that we're adding to variables to the existing dataset through a join.

--

* Two tables of data joined by a common key

---
# Four types of joins

* `left_join`: Keep all the data in the left dataset, drop any non-matching cases from the right dataset.

* `right_join`: Keep all the data in the right dataset, drop any non-matching cases from the left dataset.

* `inner_join`: Keep only data that matches in both datasets

* `full_join`: Keep all the data in both datasets. This is also sometimes referred to as an *outer* join.


--
If the keys match exactly in the two tables (datasets), all of these will 
result in the .bolder[exact] same result.

---
# Using joins to recode

Say you have a dataset like this

```{r eth-code-tbl}
set.seed(1)
disab_codes <- c("00", "10", "20", "40", "43", "50", "60", 
                 "70", "74", "80", "82", "90", "96", "98")
dis_tbl <- tibble(sid = 1:200, 
                   dis_code = sample(disab_codes, 200, replace = TRUE), 
                   score = as.integer(rnorm(200, 200, 10)))
head(dis_tbl)
```

## What if the keys don't match perfectly?

sped <- tibble(key = c(1, 2, 4), sped = rbinom(3, 1, .5))
```

sped
```
]

---
## What will happen with a left join?

--

```{r left_join}
left_join(gender, sped)
```

---
# What about a right join?

--

```{r right_join}
right_join(gender, sped)
```

---
# Inner join?

--

```{r inner_join}

```

---
# Full join?

# What if the key is not unique?

* Not a problem, as long as they are unique in .bolder[one] of the tables.
  + In this case, it's called a one-to-many join

# Example


.pull-left[
```{r stu_lev}
stu <- tibble(
        sid = rep(1:3, each = 3),
        season = rep(c("f", "w", "s"), 3),
        score = c(10, 12, 15, 
                         8,  9, 11, 
                        12, 15, 17)
        )
stu
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r stu_agg}
means <- stu %>% 
    group_by(sid) %>% 
    summarize(mean_score = mean(score))
means
```
]

---
```{r one_to_many_merge}
left_join(stu, means)
```

---
## What if key is not unique to either table?
* Generally this is an error
* Result is probably not going to be what you want (cartesian product).

<div align = "center">
<img src = img/cartesian_product.png width = 1000>
</div>

---
# Example

```{r demos}
dems <- tibble(sid = rep(1:3, each = 3),
               sped = c(rep("no", 6), rep("yes", 3)))
dems
```

---
```{r dup_merge}
left_join(stu, dems)
```

---
# How do we fix this?
In this case it's pretty simple: select for distinct cases in the demo file. 

--

In others it's not so straight forward. But the important thing to remember is
that you need to work toward making sure at least one of the keys is unique.

```{r fix_dup_merge1}
dems <- dems %>% 
    distinct(sid, .keep_all = TRUE)
dems
```

---

```{r fix_dup_merge2}
left_join(stu, dems)
```

---
# Another example
* Often you want to add summary info to your dataset.
* You can do this easily with by piping arguments

```{r pipe_merge}
ecls <- ecls %>% 
    group_by(school_id) %>% 
    summarize(sch_pre_math = mean(T1MSCALE)) %>% 
    left_join(ecls)
```

---
```{r print_ecls}
ecls
```

---
# Default behavior & changing it

* By default, the `*_join` functions will use all columns with common names as keys. 


```{r flights2}
flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2[1:2, ]
```

```{r weather}
weather[1:2, ]
```

---

```{r join_flights_weather}
left_join(flights2, weather)
```

---
## Use only some vars?

* If we were joining *flights2* and *planes*, we would not want to use the year variable in the join, because it means different things in each dataset.

```{r planes}
head(planes)
```

---
# How? 
Specify the variables with `by`

```{r join_flights2_planes}
left_join(flights2, planes, by = "tailnum")
```

---
# Mismatched names?
* What if you had data to merge like this?

.pull-left[

```{r stu_table}
stu
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r dems_table}
names(dems)[1] <- "stu_id"
dems
```

]


---
# Join w/mismatched names

```{r join_name_mismatch}
left_join(stu, dems, by = c("sid" = "stu_id"))
```

# filtering joins

---
# Filtering joins
* `semi_join()` works just like `left_join` or `inner_join` but you don't actually add the variables.

* Let's filter classrooms with extremely high math pretest average scores.

---
# First, calculate averages

```{r semi_join_extreme_high}
av_pre_mth <- ecls %>% 
    group_by(teacher_id, k_type) %>% 
    summarize(av_pre_mth = mean(T1MSCALE)) 
av_pre_mth
```

---
Next, filter for means 3 standard deviations above the mean.

```{r filter_high}
extr_high <- av_pre_mth %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    filter(av_pre_mth > (mean(av_pre_mth) + 3*sd(av_pre_mth)))
extr_high
```

---
Finally, use `semi_join` to filter.

```{r extr_high_ecls1}
extr_high_ecls <- semi_join(ecls, extr_high)
extr_high_ecls
```

---
# Filtering joins
`anti_join()` does the opposite of `semi_join`, keeping any rows that do 
**not** match.

```{r anti_join_extreme_high}
extr_low_ecls <- anti_join(ecls, extr_high)
extr_low_ecls
```

---
# Why is this so beneficial?
* Sometimes the boolean logic for `filter` can be overly complicated. 


--
* Instead, create a data frame that has only the groups you want, and 
`semi_join` it with your original data


--
* Alternatively, create a data frame that has all .bolder[but] the values you
want.

```{r jane_austen}
# install.packages(c("tidytext", "janeaustenr"))

austen_books()
```

---
# Get words

```{r get-words}
austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

---
# Count words

```{r count-words}
austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---
# Stop words

```{r stop-words}
stop_words
```

---
# Remove stop words

```{r remove-stop-words}
austen_books() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```
